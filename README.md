Titanic Survival Analysis & Visualization
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Analysis project!
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover how age, gender, and other features affected survival rates during the disaster — all visualized with clean, insightful charts.

1. What This Project Does
This project helps you:

- Understand survival patterns based on gender, age, and other features

- Visualize survival data in multiple ways

- Interpret survival rates with clean, meaningful charts

- Learn how binary survival values (0 = No, 1 = Yes) are represented in graphs

🧾 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:

Pclass – Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex – Male or Female

Age – Passenger age

SibSp – # of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch – # of parents/children aboard

Fare – Ticket fare

Embarked – Port of Embarkation

Survived – 0 = Did Not Survive, 1 = Survived

2. Visual Insights Included
✔️ Survival Rate by Gender
Shows the average survival rate for males vs females.

✔️ Count Plot of Survivors
Visual comparison of how many passengers survived or not, split by gender.

✔️ Pie Charts for Male and Female Survival
Shows the percentage of survivors within each gender group.

✔️ Age vs Survival
Swarmplot showing age distribution among survivors and non-survivors, color-coded by gender.

3. Key Takeaways
Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.

Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

Passenger class and fare also had a subtle impact on survival outcomes.

▶4. How to Run This
You can run the code:

In Google Colab

On your local Jupyter Notebook

All charts and visualizations will be generated using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

5. Tech Used
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

6. Ideas for Expansion
Add a machine learning model to predict survival

Build a dashboard using Streamlit or Gradio

Include correlation heatmaps and more advanced plots
